"In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....)"
In this app when you click one square, all squares in same row and collumn change value to +1. In case the five squares in a line create fibonacci's sequance the values of squares are again change to zero.
